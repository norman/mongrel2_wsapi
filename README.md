# Mongrel2 WSAPI Handler

This implements a [WSAPI](http://keplerproject.github.com/wsapi/) handler for
the [Mongrel2](http://mongrel2.org/home) web server.

At the moment it is neither stable nor feature complete, but after a few more
days hacking it will probably at least be usable.

Once it's somewhat usable I'll probably try to add it either to Mongrel2-Lua or
WSAPI itself, so consider this repository a temporary location just for
development.

In order to run this, you need to set up Mongrel2,
[Mongrel2-Lua](http://github.com/jsimmons/mongrel2-lua/), and all their
dependencies.
